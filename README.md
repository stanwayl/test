###Overview
Part A deals with parsing a shell script within a small subset of the standard POSIX shell grammar.
Refer to the specification listed below for more details. Part B concerns building the execution
model for the shell. In Part C we parallelized the execution of shell commands with no dependencies.
The goal was to maintain 100% accuracy but not necessarily 100% parallelization.

###Features
- 1A) Shell script parser
..* Detects invalid grammar
..* Ignores comments
..* Supports detection for subshells
..* Print out a diagnostic with the '-p'flag

- 1B) Execution model
..- I/O redirections handled (within the specification)
..- Subshells executed appropriately

- 1C) Parallelization model
..- Turn on parallelization with the '-t' flag

###Limitations
- 1A) Shell script parser
..- Cannot handle append operator '>>'
..- Doesn't support the tokens '((' or '))'
..- Memory leaks galore

- 1B) Execution model
..- Doesn't support control flow statements such as 'if', 'while', etc.
..- Possibly not closing all opened file descriptors
..- Doesn't support the shell directive 'exec' properly
..- Will not properly handle commands like 'cd' or 'rm'

- 1C) Parallelization model
..- Doesn't parallelize within each command tree, only amongst command trees
..- Shell prompt may return before all shell commands print out their results
..- More memory leaks introduced

###Installation
1. Clone this repository using 'git clone https://github.com/stanwayl/time-travel-shell'
2. Create an executable 'timetrash' by running 'make'
3. Run shell using './timetrash [OPTION] script.sh' within the directory

###Ideas for future improvements
If we don't care too much about memory, unify all the different
node structures into a single one with all needed fields. Then
don't need to sorry about type conversions and data structures
can just hold a single type of node. Also easier to just go
through them all and free them when done.
